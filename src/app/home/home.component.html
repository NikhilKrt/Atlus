        has something unique to offer.

    <h2>Interesting facts about Europe</h2>
    <p>With a land area of only 4,000,000 square miles, Europe is the second smallest continent in the world, just behind Australia.
        Despite its relatively small size, Europe is quite populous. It comes right after Asia and Africa in terms of population.
        It might be the second smallest continent, but Europe is home to the largest country in the world. Russia is so big,
        in fact, that it takes up forty percent of Europe’s land area. Europe was the main location of several historical
        periods that made a huge impact on the world like the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution. When it comes to
        land area, Europe is only two percent bigger than Canada. The etymology for the word “Europe” is uncertain up to
        the present time. Some people like to think that it came from Europa, one of Zeus’s many wives in Greek mythology.
        The name “Europe” might have originated from the Greek word “eurus,” meaning wide or broad.

    <h2>Interesting facts about America</h2>
    <p> America is the third largest continent in world, ranking just below Asia and Africa (which are the first and second largest
        continents, respectively). America covers an area of 24.71 million square kilometers or 9.54 million square miles.
        This means that 16.5% of the Earth’s total land area is taken up by America alone. Despite being the third largest
        continent in the world, America only ranks fourth when it comes to population. It is outranked by Europe which has
        a population of 739 million ( American only has 461 million). The word “America” comes from the name of Italian explorer
        Amerigo Vespucci. He is the first person to have realized that the West Indies and Brazil are actually not connected
        to Asia (as what most people have conjectured from the voyages of Columbus), but are part of another separate landmass
        of their own.

    <h2>Interesting facts about Ociania</h2>
    <p>Oceania is in a continental group consisting of numerous countries and includes Pacific islands and Australia. Often
        Australia is named as continent, but this means that the many islands and countries except Australia would then be
        not included. Oceania in fact is mostly ocean and spans a vast area as you can see below. Oceania includes 14 countries:
        Australia, Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon
        Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Oceania spreads over a vast area from 28 degrees North in the northern hemisphere
        to 55 degrees South in the southern hemisphere.
